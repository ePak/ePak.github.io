It has been almost a year since I have seriously looked at using Clojurescript. Last time I when I was trying to learn Clojurescript and Om, I ended up writing a [lein-template][om-fireplace-brepl] to help with scaffolding an environment mentioned [previously]({% post_url 2014-04-18-om-fireplace-browser-repl %}).

Since that, other amazing libraries like [figwheel][figwheel] and [weasel][weasel] were created and [chestnut][chestnut] wraps up these libraries into a template to get you started on Clojurescript quickly. But I am one of those people always wants to know how things work and what settings are for what and why. So I have decided that I will try to "re-create" something like chestnut step-by-step and document them in future posts with separate commits in a repo on Github, so other people could have a reference of what settings are for which component.
